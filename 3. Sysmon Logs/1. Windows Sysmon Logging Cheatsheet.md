**Sysmon download:**
- Step 1: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon
- Step 2: `C:\Tools\Sysmon> sysmon.exe -i -accepteula -h md5,sha256,imphash -l -n`-> Install Sysmon.
- Step 3: `C:\Tools\Sysmon> sysmon.exe -c filename.xml` -> Sysmon rule

```
### Log size
- **Check the log size:** `wevtutil gl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`
- **It is HIGHLY recommended that the Sysmon/Operational log be set to:**
	- **Set log:** `wevtutil sl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational /ms:1048576000`
	- Or: `WevtUtil sl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational /ms:2097152000`

### AV and EDR
Many Anti-Virus and EDR solutions should have the Sysmon binary and driver excluded from being scanned or performance impacts may be overwhelming.

### Service, Registry and File monitoring
If you are going to use Sysmon in production, you should monitor changes to the Sysmon Registry keys and config.xml file for any attacks and/or changes against the service.

- **Registry Keys** -> use Event ID 4657:
	- `Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Sysmon64`
	- `Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SysmonDrv` 

- **Sysmon Service:**
	- **Sysmon ID 4** in the `Sysmon/Operational` log will register the service has been stopped.
	- Look for Security log Event IDs 4688 (Process Started), and 4689 (Process Terminated).

- **config.xml:**
	- The default name for the Sysmon **config.xml** of course should be changed and moved so that is not in the obvious default location of `C:\Windows`.
	- Craft an auditing rule to monitor reads to this file -> Event ID 4663 (Accesses: ReadData).
# Sysmon Configuration File
### Config
Modify **Event ID 7** from `sysmonconfig-export.xml`
- **"include" -> "exclude"** : allow us to capture the necessary data.

![](../6.%20Image/Pasted%20image%2020250616135043.png)

- **Update Sysmon**: `C:\Tools\Sysmon> sysmon.exe -c sysmonconfig-export.xml

![](../6.%20Image/Pasted%20image%2020250616135222.png)

- To view Sysmon events, navigate to the Event Viewer and access "**Applications and Services" -> "Microsoft" -> "Windows" -> "Sysmon."**
### Includes vs Excludes

```ad-note
Items that you want to collect that are noisy and generate a LOT of events, you might only include specific locations for some selected items.

So give what you are including versus excluding some serious thought and overlap what you exclude with one Event ID with another.
```

### Different Uses
- **Malware Labs** - Generally collecting all the things and only exclude normal baseline image items.
- **Personal Work Systems** - A great use of excludes only and limit what you collect as to not generate a ton of events for log management.
	- Using a tuned Sysmon config.xml and a combination of your log management endpoint agent configuration.
- **Incident Response** - This may be similar to a malware lab.
- **Production Systems** - Use Sysmon with excludes of normal baseline items for that system to generate as little as possible and collect only very actionable high value items. 
	- Consider CPU, memory and total events generated before rolling out into production, and use Group Policy to control configurations as much as possible.
- High Risk systems – Use Sysmon to monitor systems that pose a high risk, either to lack of, or inability to patch, exposed to the Internet, cannot be fully locked down, etc. 
	- A combination of excludes and includes might be used in this example.

# Sysmon Logs
- [Sysmon Event ID 1 - Process Creation](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventid=90001): Useful for hunts targeting abnormal parent-child process hierarchies, as illustrated in the first lesson with Process Hacker. It's an event we can use later.
- [Sysmon Event ID 2 - A process changed a file creation time](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventid=90002): Helpful in spotting "time stomp" attacks, where attackers alter file creation times. Bear in mind, not all such actions signal malicious intent.
- [Sysmon Event ID 3 - Network connection](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventid=90003): A source of abundant noise since machines are perpetually establishing network connections. We may uncover anomalies, but let's consider other quieter areas first.
- [Sysmon Event ID 4 - Sysmon service state changed](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventid=90004): Could be a useful hunt if attackers attempt to stop Sysmon, though the majority of these events are likely benign and informational, considering Sysmon's frequent legitimate starts and stops.
- [Sysmon Event ID 5 - Process terminated](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventid=90005): This might aid us in detecting when attackers kill key processes or use sacrificial ones. For instance, Cobalt Strike often spawns temporary processes like werfault, the termination of which would be logged here, as well as the creation in ID 1.
- [Sysmon Event ID 6 - Driver loaded](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventid=90006): A potential flag for BYOD (bring your own driver) attacks, though this is less common. Before diving deep into this, let's weed out more conspicuous threats first.
- [Sysmon Event ID 7 - Image loaded](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventid=90007): Allows us to track dll loads, which is handy in detecting DLL hijacks.
- [Sysmon Event ID 8 - CreateRemoteThread](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventid=90008): Potentially aids in identifying injected threads. While remote threads can be created legitimately, if an attacker misuses this API, we can potentially trace their rogue process and what they injected into.
- [Sysmon Event ID 10 - ProcessAccess](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventid=90010): Useful for spotting remote code injection and memory dumping, as it records when handles on processes are made.
- [Sysmon Event ID 11 - FileCreate](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventid=90011): With many files being created frequently due to updates, downloads, etc., it might be challenging to aim our hunt directly here. However, these events can be beneficial in correlating or identifying a file's origins later.
- [Sysmon Event ID 12 - RegistryEvent (Object create and delete)](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventid=90012) & [Sysmon Event ID 13 - RegistryEvent (Value Set)](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventid=90013): While numerous events take place here, many registry events can be malicious, and with a good idea of what to look for, hunting here can be fruitful.
- [Sysmon Event ID 15 - FileCreateStreamHash](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventid=90015): Relates to file streams and the "Mark of the Web" pertaining to external downloads, but we'll leave this aside for now.
- [Sysmon Event ID 16 - Sysmon config state changed](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventid=90016): Logs alterations in Sysmon configuration, useful for spotting tampering.
- [Sysmon Event ID 17 - Pipe created](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventid=90017) & [Sysmon Event ID 18 - Pipe connected](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventid=90018): Record pipe creations and connections. They can help observe malware's interprocess communication attempts, usage of [PsExec](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec), and SMB lateral movement.
- [Sysmon Event ID 22 - DNSEvent](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventid=90022): Tracks DNS queries, which can be beneficial for monitoring beacon resolutions and DNS beacons.
- [Sysmon Event ID 23 - FileDelete](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventid=90023): Monitors file deletions, which can provide insights into whether a threat actor cleaned up their malware, deleted crucial files, or possibly attempted a ransomware attack.
- [Sysmon Event ID 25 - ProcessTampering (Process image change)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon): Alerts on behaviors such as process herpadering, acting as a mini AV alert filter.

# Filtering Sysmon Events
- `Sysmon -h` - Access help.
- `Sysmon /? config` - Get detailed information for Sysmon config.
### Conditions
1. Use a configuration file to filter out log data that is not important or you deem noisy.
2. Do not be overly broad with exclusions. Be very specific on exclusions as much as possible. For example exclude by the full path and binary versus just excluding a whole folder.
3. Keep config files organized. Keep similar type items together, `folders`, `image`, `contains`, etc.
4. Use comments! `<!-- ---->`
5. Consider ignoring Browsers on endpoints (This accounts for a TON of events).

| **Condition** | Description                                                                                |

| `excludes`    | Trường **không** chứa chuỗi này.                                                           |
| `begin with`  | Bắt đầu bằng chuỗi này.                                                                    |
| `end with`    | Kết thúc bằng chuỗi này.                                                                   |
| `less than`   | So sánh chuỗi lexicographically nhỏ hơn.                                                   |
| `more than`   | So sánh chuỗi lớn hơn.                                                                     |
| `image`       | So khớp đường dẫn hoặc tên file (vd: `lsass.exe` khớp với `C:\Windows\System32\lsass.exe`) |
