# **Powershell & C-Sharp and Runtime environment**

- **C# - Powershell** is a managed language, meaning it needs a backend runtime to execute its code, does not directly run as assembly and C (unmanaged language).
- **.NET CLR** (Common Language Runtime) serves as a backend runtime environment.
=> **A managed process** relies on the CLR to execute C# code.

```ad-note
**Managed code** is compiled into a bytecode format (**.exe**, **.dll**) that the runtime processes and executes, then get compiled into machine code running on CPU.
```

# **Detection Demo**
As defenders, we can leverage this knowledge to detect unusual **C# injections** or **executions** within our environment. To accomplish this, we can utilize a useful utility called [Process Hacker](https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/).

Notably, **"powershell.exe"**, a managed process:

=> **powershell.exe** reveals the label **"Process is managed (.NET)"** confirming its managed status.

Examining the module loads for `powershell.exe`, clicking **"Properties"**, and navigating to **"Modules"**:

- `clr.dll`and `clrjit.dll` are used when C# code is ran as part of the runtime to execute the bytecode.

```ad-warning
If we observe these DLLs loaded in processes that typically do not require them (**notepad.exe**, **svchost.exe**,...), it suggests a potential [execute-assembly](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/blog/cobalt-strike-3-11-the-snake-that-eats-its-tail/) or [unmanaged PowerShell injection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tvfb9poTKg&ab_channel=RaphaelMudge) attack.
```

# **Attacking Demo**

To showcase **unmanaged PowerShell injection**, we can inject an [unmanaged PowerShell-like DLL](https://github.com/leechristensen/UnmanagedPowerShell) into a random process, such as `spoolsv.exe`. We can do that by utilizing the [PSInject project](https://github.com/EmpireProject/PSInject) in the following manner:

```powershell
 powershell -ep bypass
 Import-Module .\Invoke-PSInject.ps1
 Invoke-PSInject -ProcId [Process ID of spoolsv.exe] -PoshCode "V3JpdGUtSG9zdCAiSGVsbG8sIEd1c
```

![](../6.%20Image/Pasted%20image%2020250517203400.png)

After the injection, we observe that **"spoolsv.exe"** transitions from an unmanaged to a managed state.

Referring to both the related **"Modules"** tab of Process Hacker and Sysmon `Event ID 7`, we can examine the DLL load information to validate the presence of the aforementioned DLLs:

**Looking on EventViewer:**

### **IOCs Analysis**
1. **clr.dll**, **clrjit.dll** are loaded in processes don't require them - Example: **spoolsv.exe**
2. Unmanaged process becomes into **managed (.NET)**
