# **Detection Example 1: Detecting DLL Hijacking**

## **DLL Hijacking**

**Image Loaded - Event ID 7**:

**Event Logs** contains:
- DLL signing status => **Microsoft Windows (true)**
- Process or image responsible for loading DLL => **mmc.exe** loaded **psapi.dll**
- Specific DLL was loaded => **psapi.dll**

## **ATTACKING DEMO**
For the purpose of our detection, we will focus on a specific hijack involving the vulnerable executable **calc.exe** and a list of DLLs that can be hijacked.

Attempt the hijack using **"calc.exe"** and **"WININET.dll"** as an example, utilizing Stephen Fewer's **"hello world"** [reflective DLL](https://github.com/stephenfewer/ReflectiveDLLInjection/tree/master/bin):
- Renaming `reflective_dll.x64.dll` to `WININET.dll`.
- Moving `calc.exe` from `C:\Windows\System32` along with `WININET.dll` to a writable directory (such as the `Desktop`).
- Executing `calc.exe`, we achieve success.
Instead of the Calculator application, a [MessageBox](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-messageboxa) is displayed.

```
## **DETECTION DEMO**
First, we filter the event logs to focus on `Event ID 7`.
Subsequently, we search for instances of **"calc.exe"** to identify the DLL load associated with our hijack.

Now, we can observe several indicators of compromise (IOCs) to create effective detection rules. Compare this to an authenticate load of **"wininet.dll"** by **"calc.exe"**.

### **IOCs Analysis:**
1. **"calc.exe"** resides in **System32** or perhaps **Syswow64**, cannot be found in a writable directory. 
	=> A copy of **"calc.exe"** in a writable directory serves as an IOC.
2. **"WININET.dll"**, originally located in System32, should not be loaded outside of System32 by calc.exe. 
	=> If instances of **"WININET.dll"** loading occur outside of **System32** with **"calc.exe"** as the parent process, it indicates a DLL hijack within **calc.exe**.
3. The original **"WININET.dll"** is **Microsoft-signed**, while our injected DLL remains unsigned.
