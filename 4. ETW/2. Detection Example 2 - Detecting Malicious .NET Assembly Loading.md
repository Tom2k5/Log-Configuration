# LotL - BYOL
- Adversaries employed a strategy known as ["Living off the Land" (LotL)](https://www.attackiq.com/2023/03/16/hiding-in-plain-sight/), exploiting legitimate system tools, such as PowerShell, to carry out their malicious operations.
	=> This approach reduces the risk of detection since it involves the use of tools that are native to the system, and therefore less likely to raise suspicion.

- Responding to these defensive advancements, attackers have developed a new approach that Mandiant labels as ["Bring Your Own Land" (BYOL)](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/bring-your-own-land-novel-red-teaming-technique). Instead of relying on the tools already present on a victim's system, threat actors and penetration testers emulating these tactics now employ .NET assemblies executed entirely in memory.
	=> This involves creating custom-built tools using languages like C#, rendering them independent of the pre-existing tools on the target system.

- The **"Bring Your Own Land"** lands is quite effective for the following reasons:
	- Each Windows system comes equipped with a certain version of .NET pre-installed by default.
	- A salient feature of .NET is its managed nature, alleviating the need for programmers to manually handle memory management because of CLR runtime.
	- Using .NET assemblies ability is to be loaded directly into memory. This means that an executable or DLL does not need to be written physically to the disk - instead, it is executed directly in memory. This behavior can help bypass some forms of detection that rely on inspecting files written to disk.
	- Microsoft has integrated a wide range of libraries into the .NET framework (establishing HTTP connections, implementing cryptographic operations, and enabling inter-process communication (IPC),...

- A powerful illustration of this BYOL strategy is the ["execute-assembly"](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/blog/cobalt-strike-3-11-the-snake-that-eats-its-tail/) command implemented in CobaltStrike.
	=> CobaltStrike's **'execute-assembly'** command allows the user to execute .NET assemblies directly from memory, making it an ideal tool for implementing a BYOL strategy.
# Attacking Demo
- Emulate a **malicious .NET assembly** load by executing a precompiled version of [Seatbelt](https://github.com/GhostPack/Seatbelt) that resides on disk.
- `Seatbelt` is a well-known **.NET assembly**, often employed by adversaries who load and execute it in memory to gain situational awareness on a compromised system.
`
**Seatbelt.exe** would trigger the loading of key **.NET-related DLLs** such as `clr.dll` and `mscoree.dll`.

### **Event Viewer**

![](../6.%20Image/Pasted%20image%2020250518195047.png)

![](../6.%20Image/Pasted%20image%2020250518195057.png)

=> It informs us about the DLLs (`clr.dll`, `mscoree.dll`) being loaded, but it doesn't provide granular details about the actual content of the loaded **.NET assembly**.
### **ETW**
To gain deeper insights into the actual assembly being loaded, we can use ETW and specifically the `Microsoft-Windows-DotNETRuntime` provider.

Use **SilkETW** to collect data from the `Microsoft-Windows-DotNETRuntime` provider:

```powershell
c:\Tools\SilkETW_SilkService_v8\v8\SilkETW>SilkETW.exe -t user -pn Microsoft-Windows-DotNETRuntime -uk 0x2038 -ot file -p C:\windows\temp\etw.json
```

![](../6.%20Image/Pasted%20image%2020250518215336.png)

Selectively targeting a specific subset (indicated by `0x2038`), which includes: `JitKeyword`, `InteropKeyword`, `LoaderKeyword`, and `NGenKeyword`:
- `JitKeyword` relates to the Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation events, providing information on the methods being compiled at runtime. This could be particularly useful for understanding the execution flow of the .NET assembly.
- `InteropKeyword` refers to Interoperability events, which come into play when managed code interacts with unmanaged code. These events could provide insights into potential interactions with native APIs or other unmanaged components.
- `LoaderKeyword` events provide details on the assembly loading process within the .NET runtime, which can be vital for understanding what .NET assemblies are being loaded and potentially executed.
- `NGenKeyword` corresponds to Native Image Generator (NGen) events, which are concerned with the creation and usage of precompiled .NET assemblies. Monitoring these could help detect scenarios where attackers use precompiled .NET assemblies to evade JIT-related detections.

This [blog post](https://medium.com/threat-hunters-forge/threat-hunting-with-etw-events-and-helk-part-1-installing-silketw-6eb74815e4a0) provides valuable perspectives on SilkETW as well as the identification of malware based on .NET.

### **IOCs** **Analysis**
To identify **malicious .NET assembly** loading:
- Scrutinize the activity related to the loading of [.NET-associated DLLs](https://redhead0ntherun.medium.com/detecting-net-c-injection-execute-assembly-1894dbb04ff7), specifically `clr.dll` and `mscoree.dll`.
- This type of DLL loading behavior can be detected by Sysmon's **Event ID 7**.
